Geometric Series Sum Calculator
The series he needs to work with is 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ...1/N, where each term is obtained by dividing the previous term by 2.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   int a;
   float b=1.0,sum=0;
   scanf("%d", &a);
   
   for(int i=1;i<=a;i++)
   {
       printf("1.0/%.1f ", b);
       float num=1.0/b;
       sum+= num;
       b=b*2;
   }
   printf("\n%.2f ", sum);

    return 0;
}

Sample Input 1:
6 (Number of Terms in the series)
Sample Output 1:
1.97 (Sum of the Geometric series)

Sample Input 2:
-1
Sample Output 2:
0.00
